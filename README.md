## Description

This challenge was to create a full stack application allowing for account creation, user login and authentication, blogging, and commenting.  There was no starter code and everything was built from the ground up and deployed to Heroku.  There were specific challenges when rendering with handlebars, as well as ensuring users can only edit and delete their notes.
